# `<jwplayer-video>`

A custom element (web component) for the JW player.

The element API matches the HTML5 `<video>` tag, so it can be easily swapped with other media, and be compatible with other UI components that work with the video tag.

One of the goals was to have `<jwplayer-video>` seamlessly integrate with [Media Chrome](https://github.com/muxinc/media-chrome).
